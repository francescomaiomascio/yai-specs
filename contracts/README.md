# Contracts

Contracts are the normative law of YAI: axioms, invariants, boundaries, terminology, and formal proofs.
They define what must be true across all consumers.

## Structure

- `axioms/` - foundational truths
- `invariants/` - required global properties
- `boundaries/` - layer boundaries and ownership
- `terminology/` - canonical definitions
- `extensions/` - domain-specific lawful extensions
- `formal/` - TLA+ specs and proof artifacts

## Authority

1. `axioms/`
2. `invariants/`
3. `boundaries/`
4. `terminology/`
